**Category:** Steganography

**Solves:** 264
**Description:**

> This picture was found on a high level target's computer. Analysts did a quick examination but could not find anything.
however, Nicholas Cage told us that the target may have used a method of message hiding similar to the method used on the back of the constitution.
The text could essentially be hiding in plain sight.
